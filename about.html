    <h1> Alice Frazier </h1>
    <p>If you can't tell by my home page my favorite television show is Supernatural!</p>

    <p>I Currently live in Indianapolis, IN. I previously worked for Dominion Dealer Solutions and started there as website tech support, which I loved doing, unfortunately our website team was dissolved and we no longer hosted websites so then I supported our CRM, Dominion Vision.</p>

    <p>For two years I was a teacher at Sylvan Learning Center where I taught the Lego Robotics class and the Tynker Coding class. If you would like more information on these programs check them out at the links below.</p>
